  If you read it into memory and write it out, it could fail in tight memory situations. I'm looking for something like copyfile(const char* from, const char* to) or copyfile(path from, path to), preferably something in Boost if it has it.  If you find it for me, it's more likely I'll get to implementing it.Quote from: nelisky on August 26, 2010, 01:21:57 AMAs for the file copy, why add to the boost dependency? I for one would love to get a core lib with very little deps.We require Boost for JSON and a dozen things replacing dependencies on wxWidgets.  Boost is good, portable stuff, we should not shy away from it.

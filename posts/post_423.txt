  I doubt there's an mmap(2) on Windows.  I'd rather call an existing file copy function than make and test my own.Quote from: nelisky on August 27, 2010, 01:21:09 AMBut if you are already using features from boost::filesystem you can use copy_file from that. I just think that, if not already required for something else, it's a tad overkill.Thanks.  I thought it would be in there somewhere.We already use boost::filesystem in a dozen places.  It's not a new added dependency.  It gives us a lot of portable stuff that we would otherwise have to have a #ifdef for each OS and test everywhere.

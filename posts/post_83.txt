  Are you using wxWidgets 2.9.0?Â  I don't recommend using anything other than 2.9.0.It looks like they've got a reference in the wx headers (arrstr.h) to something outside of wxBase.Removing -D__WXDEBUG__ from bitcoin's makefile would probably solve it.If that doesn't work and you just want to get it working, you could edit wxWidgets include/wx/arrstr.h, line 167 and comment out the wxASSERT_MSG.

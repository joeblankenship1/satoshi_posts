  The only thing I can think of is to see if there are other versions of mingwm10.dll you can get.  mingwm10.dll is a tiny little DLL that came with the MinGW compiler that you need when you build for multi-thread.  I don't know exactly what it does, but it probably just says something like "yes Windows, see I'm in a DLL like you insisted."The end of your debug.log file might show the last thing it was doing before it crashed.

  BTW, I did come to my senses after that brief bout with 1.3, this release is still going to be 0.3 beta not 1.0.I really appreciate the effort, but there are a lot of problems.We don't want to lead with "anonymous".  (I've been meaning to edit the homepage)"The developers expect that this will result in a stable-with-respect-to-energy currency outside the reach of any government." -- I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion. It's not stable-with-respect-to-energy.  There was a discussion on this.  It's not tied to the cost of energy.  NLS's estimate based on energy was a good estimated starting point, but market forces will increasingly dominate. Sorry to be a wet blanket.  Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard.  There's nothing to relate it to.

  LR and Pecunix have many established exchanges to paper currencies by various payment methods, and a number of vendors accept them as payment, so an exchange link between Bitcoin and LR/Pecunix would give us 2nd-hop access to all that.  The possibility to cash out through them would help support the value of bitcoins.Bitcoin has unique properties that would be complementary.  LR/Pecunix are easy to spend anonymously, but hard to buy anonymously and not worth the trouble to buy in small amounts.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is easy to get in small amounts anonymously.  It would be convenient to buy LR/Pecunix with bitcoins rather than through conventional payment methods.Most customers who convert to LR to buy something would probably ask the seller first if they accept Bitcoin, encouraging them to start accepting it.

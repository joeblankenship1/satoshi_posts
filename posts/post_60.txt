Perhaps it has to do with my connection's very high latency (2000ms or more on average) 2 seconds of latency in both directions should reduce your generation success by less than 1%.Quote from: Sabunir on February 16, 2010, 08:51:51 AMand/or my high packet loss (sometimes up to 10% loss)?Probably OK, but I'm not sure.  The protocol is designed to resync to the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're connected to until received.  If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap.  Before the original release I did a test dropping 1 out of 4 random messages under heavy load until I could run it overnight without any nodes getting stuck.

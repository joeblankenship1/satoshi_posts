  I agree.  All transactions, IP changes, renewals, etc. should have some fee that goes to the miners.You might consider a certain amount of work to generate a domain, instead of a fixed total circulation.  The work per domain could be on a schedule that grows with Moore's Law.  That way the number of domains would grow with demand and the number of people using it.

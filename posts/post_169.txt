  Everybody needs to connect to the same IRC server and channel so they can find each other.Quote from: Vasiliev on June 25, 2010, 11:50:15 PMYou may want to leave Freenode in as a fallback server -- if his server doesn't work, use Freenode's.It might not be good if we suddenly rushed freenode with a ton of users all at once.The fallback is our own seed system. irc.lfnet.org is pretty old and has impressive uptime. Â I think it's going to be fine.We could take IRC out at some point if we want, but I'd rather ease into it and just test our own seed system as a backup for now, and I really like the complementary redundant attributes of the two different systems.

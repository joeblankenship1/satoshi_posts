  The change list is basically encompassed by what's listed in the first message.  Everyone should upgrade to get the important security improvements.Minimizing to tray had at least 3 different glitches and bugs on Linux, including a crash one, so I disabled it again.  You can still re-enable the option with "-minimizetotray" if you want to use it anyway.  The bugs/glitches are somewhere in wxWidgets or GTK or Gnome and I don't know how to fix them.  Sorry, I just don't know what else to do, it's just too glitchy and buggy to have as a mainline feature.

  On Windows, findstr /c:"version message" debug.logIt looks like the bad chain was on block 74678 recently.  Can't wait to overtake it.On the stats at http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php  there's been 5 blocks per hour in the last 3 hours.  We had a difficulty adjustment about a day ago that should have put it back to 6 blocks per hour.

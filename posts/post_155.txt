  Many big ISPs give you a new IP every time you connect, usually in the same class B (a.b.?.?). Â Maybe you should have a minimum time between payments per class-B.If you can't solve the problem, you can always keep lowering the amount of bitcoins given until it's manageable, and always require captcha.

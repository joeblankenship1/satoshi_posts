  Red, thanks for telling me privately first!  Please go ahead and post it (and relieve the suspense for everyone!)His point is that transactions paid to a Bitcoin Address are only as secure as the hash function.  To make Bitcoin Addresses short, they are a hash of the public key, not the public key itself.  An attacker would only have to break the hash function, not ECDSA.

How far would <some goverment> get?This is what makes me think the people objecting don't know what they're talking about. Â It can't "shut down the complete network". I've never objected this change/idea, just asking if this was possible and to what extent.What's wrong with getting informed? My apologies, your post was indeed a question not a statement.

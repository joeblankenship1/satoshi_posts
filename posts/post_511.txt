  Version 0.3.17 is now available. Changes:- new getwork, thanks m0mchil- added transaction fee setting in UI options menu- free transaction limits- sendtoaddress returns transaction id instead of "sent"- getaccountaddress <account>The UI transaction fee setting was easy since it was still there from 0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance <account> will be in the next release.  We still have some more changes to make first.Downloads:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.17/

  Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2010, 10:00:26 PMhis block count remains "stuck" at 1698.He was generating invalid blocks at difficulty 1.0.  He must have a corrupted entry in his blk0001.dat or blkindex.dat file.  He just needs to delete blk*.dat and let it redownload.The safety lockdown detected the problem and was displaying "WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!" because it saw a longer chain existed that it was unable to accept.  The safety lockdown cannot stop generation or it would create an attack possibility.Quote from: gavinandresen on October 22, 2010, 02:25:14 PMThe Bitcoin client really shouldn't allow coin generation until you have all of the blocks up to the last block checkpoint.Good idea, I made a change to make sure it won't generate before checkpoint block 74000.

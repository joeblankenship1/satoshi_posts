  It must be a rounding error when getinfo converts to floating point to return the JSON-RPC result.Â  The only place where it uses floating point to represent money is returning a value in JSON-RPC.1.139999999999 is longer than bitcoin can internally represent.internally, it could only be:1.13999999 or1.140000001.139999999999 is much much closer to 1.14000000 than 1.13999999, so it must be 1.14000000.The code is this:(double)GetBalance() / (double)COIN.(I can't think of an easy way to fix it at the moment)

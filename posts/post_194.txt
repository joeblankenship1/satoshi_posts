  I don't think you have a particular problem, I think your system is laggy because you're running a lot of things at once and hitting the pagefile because memory is full.  You confirmed when you shut off generation that your CPU drops to 0%, so the CPU usage is definitely all idle priority.  There's nothing in the 0.3.1 that would affect these things.

One of them, wxMac, exists in two versions: Classic and Carbon. The Classic version is the only one to work on Mac OS version 8. The Carbon version may be built either as CFM or Mach-O (binary format, like ELF) and the former may run under OS 9 while the latter only runs under OS X. Finally, there is a new Cocoa port which can only be used under OS X. To summarize:    * If you want to test for all Mac platforms, classic and OS X, you should test both __WXMAC__ and __WXCOCOA__.    * If you want to test for any GUI Mac port under OS X, use __WXOSX__.    * If you want to test for any port under Mac OS X, including, for example, wxGTK and also wxBase, use __DARWIN__"

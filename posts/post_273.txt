  Quote from: BitLex on July 25, 2010, 08:45:38 PMi got some problems here too trying to get this run on PHP.so far i had no luck, neither the wiki-sample (jsonRPCClient trying to fopen(http://username:password@localhost:8332/)), nor my curl-sample (using setopt CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_BASIC) seem to work.That's strange, didn't someone just say that was supposed to work?  (what library was he using?)  Post if you figure out what wrong.I hope it's not going to put up this much of a fight for all PHP users.Looks like we've got the Fortran scenario already.

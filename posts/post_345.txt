  Quote from: dkaparis on August 11, 2010, 11:00:16 PMThere is this piece of code in headers.h:#ifdef __WXMAC_OSX__#define __WXMAC__ 1#define __WXOSX__ 1#define __BSD__ 1#endif#endifThat code was a bad idea anyway, I'm deleting it.Â  Any Mac code should only use __WXMAC_OSX__, not __WXMAC__ or __WXOSX__, and we should stop using __BSD__.Quote#if (defined(__unix__) || defined(unix)) && !defined(USG)#include <sys/param.h>#endifWill that definitely cause BSD to be defined on Mac?

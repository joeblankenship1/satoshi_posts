  That's the first time I've seen this error.How many blocks do you have? (in the status bar)You should move your blk*.dat files (in ~/.bitcoin) to another directory and let it start over downloading the block chain again.Â  If you don't mind, could you keep the old blk*.dat files for a little while in case I need to look at them?

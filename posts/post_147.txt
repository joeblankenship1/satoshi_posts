  Quote from: laszlo on June 14, 2010, 06:30:58 PMI run an IRC server you can use, it's fairly stable but it's not on redundant connections or anything.  It is only two servers right now but we don't mess with it or anything, it just runs.My box is a dedicated irc server: 2:28PM  up 838 days, 20:54, 1 user, load averages: 0.06, 0.08, 0.08You can use irc.lfnet.org to connect.This seems like a good idea.What does everyone think, should we make the switch for 0.3?

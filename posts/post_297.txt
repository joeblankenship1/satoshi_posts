  I don't get how it let you send if it was not matured.  Your balance would have been lower than the amount.  It would have said balance 0.01, right?  If I try that it says "you don't have enough money" or "Insufficient funds" from the command line.How many blocks did it say it had left to mature when you sent?There's a chance it might still go through.Have you copied or moved your wallet.dat in any way?

  Try -datadir=Last time I tried $(shell /usr/bin/wx-config), there was immediate hollering about build problems with it.  There wasn't time to investigate at the time.One problem with $(shell /usr/bin/wx-config) is it will pick up any version (wx 2.8 ) and any configuration (non-UTF-8 ) of wxWidgets that happens to be there.  -lwx_gtk2ud-2.9 only matches the right configuration.  It fails if wxWidgets was built with the wrong configuration. QuoteIirc, chatting in #wxwidgets on freenode, the devs there were baffled why that was used.Did they say why they were baffled? QuoteThis is because on my system the path is /usr/include/wx-2.9/wx/wx.hWhy is it there?  Was it included by the OS, or did you have to build it?  If you built it, I wonder why it would put itself in a different place.Has wxWidgets 2.9 finally started to become available as a debian package?Maybe we should do this:INCLUDEPATHS= \ -I"/usr/local/include/wx-2.9" \ -I"/usr/local/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" \ -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" \ -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9"Again, those paths help make sure it's only 2.9 and will fail with 2.8.wxWidgets 2.8 comes in ANSI and UTF-16, both wrong for us.  It's tempting because it's so easily available as a package; a lot of people were frustrated by it until we started hardcoding 2.9 into the makefile.

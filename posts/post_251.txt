  Quote from: gavinandresen on July 21, 2010, 12:11:10 PMI just did a quick survey of 20 .conf files in /etc on my debian system, and found: 1 file used "key value" 5 used "key=value"  Thanks for that survey!I find "key value" a little unnatural.  There ought to be a more definite separator between key and value that suggests assignment.  The space people may just be getting lazy using their language's split function.key=some full sentence with spaces in it.  # seems more clearkey some full sentence with spaces in it.  # than thisAllright then, lets go with self-parsed mapConfig, syntax:# commentkey=valuefile extension .conf.  What's the filename, is it ~/.bitcoin/settings.conf or ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf or what?   I think we better strip whitespace at the beginning and end of the key and the value.# user who likes column formatted k            = valuekey         = valuelongerkey =   this sentence would be this    # "this sentence would be this"        key = value   # guess this is ok too  nextkey = value      right = justifiedThe normal syntax should be "key=value", but you can't blame people for the occasional "key = value".

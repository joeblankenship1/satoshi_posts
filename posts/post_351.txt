  That big of a difference in speed, by a factor of 4 or 6, feels like it's likely to be some quirky weak spot or instruction that the old chip is slow with.  Unless it's a touted feature of the i5 that they made SSE2 six times faster.A quick summary:Xeon Quad        41% slowerCore 2 Duo        55% slowerCore 2 Duo        same (vess)Core 2 Quad      50% slowerCore i5            200% faster (nelisky)Core i5            100% faster (vess)AMD Opteron    105% fasteraceat64:My system went from ~7100 to ~4200.This particular system has dual Intel Xeon Quad-Core CPUs (E5335) @ 2.00GHz.impossible7:on an Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 running x86_64 linux it was 55% slower compared to the stock version (r121)nelisky:My Core2Quad (Q6600) slowed down 50%, my i5 improved ~200%, impossible7:on an AMD Opteron 2374 HE running x86_64 linux I got a 105% improvement (!)

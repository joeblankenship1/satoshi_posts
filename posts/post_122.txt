  http://127.0.0.1:8330/?to=domain.com&amount=200.00&comment=order_12345orhttp://127.0.0.1:8330/?to=<bitcoinaddress><separatorchar>1.2.3.4&amount=200.00But as long as the link is already doing the typing for you, I don't see much benefit in using a domain address instead of bitcoin address.  With a bitcoin address, the user can't send an unidentified payment.  They can't send payment until they've been given a correct bitcoin address to send to.What would be nice about sending by domain is you could visually verify who it's going to.A more crucial issue is what if the browser isn't allowed to connect to 127.0.0.1:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=63.msg1589#msg1589and if that's true, then what about that example freenet link that had 127.0.0.1 in it?

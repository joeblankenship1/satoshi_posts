  When and how fast did memory usage increase?  Right away, slowly over a long time, or starting at some later event?I have -daemon running on ubuntu 9.10 64-bit and memory usage is steady.It has to be something about the difference on the server besides 64-bit.  Maybe some malfunction from the lack of GUI.  A memory leak debug tool could give a clue.

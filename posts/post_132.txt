  On Ubuntu 10.04 it wouldn't remove the taskbar button cleanly, so I made it leave it there.But now that you mention it, it's probably better to have the feature, even if it's messy, than not to have it, though it may confuse a few people when the taskbar button temporarily stays around but disappears if you click on it.Updated SVN.Thanks for testing.

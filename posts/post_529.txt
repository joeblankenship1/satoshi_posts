I can't think of a good solution for the interface, that's the problem.  Maybe "*" special case like "" is.  Everyone would have to make sure no user can create account name "*".Quote from: jgarzik on December 09, 2010, 04:13:50 PMSure, and that's easy enough to track with transactions.I don't get how that's "easy" to track with transactions.

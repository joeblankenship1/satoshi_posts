  Right, that is quite a bit better.  Can you give me any examples of other stuff that does it that way?  (and what the command line looks like)The main change you're talking about here is instead of -rpcpw= when you start bitcoind, you'd use a switch that specifies a text file to go and read it from, right?  (any ideas what I should name the switch?)

  What language is your computer set to?  Is it set to German, Dutch or Italian?  Is it one of those sub-languages like "nl-??"?It's trying to load a translation and failing.  You could delete the locale directory that came with bitcoin so it doesn't try to use it.Can someone test each language on Ubuntu and see if there's a problem with just one of them or maybe all three?

  OK, back to 0.3 then.Please download RC4 and check it over as soon as possible.  I'd like to release it soon.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=199.msg1927#msg1927Other than the version number change, which included changes in readme.txt and setup.nsi, I reduced the maximum number of outbound connections from 15 to 8 so nodes that accept inbound don't get too many connections.  15 was a lot more than needed.  8 is still plenty for redundancy.

  I reduced max outbound connections from 15 to 8 in RC4.15 was way more than we needed for redundancy. Â 8 is still plenty of redundancy.As the nodes upgrade to this version, this will cut in half the number of connections that inbound accepting nodes get.If anyone wants more than 8 connections, they can open port 8333 on their firewall.

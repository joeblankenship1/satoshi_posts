  The order matters not to the program, but it matters to me maintaining it.  If it jumbles the order of the .po file then I can't diff for changes.  I have to update all 7 translation files when I change the English text in the program, and it's easier when they're all in the same order.I can still put it back into normal order by making poedit rescan it.It is normal that untranslated strings are shown on top.Quote from: eurekafag on October 06, 2010, 07:39:36 PMBy the way, there are some similar lines that possibly may be replaced by one. They are very close by meaning and differs only by 1-2 words. Just a suggestion of course.I know, but not easily without complicating the sourcecode.

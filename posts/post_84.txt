  Quote from: Cdecker on February 27, 2010, 03:24:07 AMHow about an SVG version? That way we could automatically generate smaller and larger versions as needed.I don't know how to do SVG, but I did the original very large, over 500 pixels across, so it can be scaled down.  I'll give the original when I'm finished.I had to custom tweak each icon size so the vertical lines land square on their pixels, otherwise they're ugly blurry and inconsistent.  Such is the challenge of making icons.  The original will be good for scaling to custom sizes between 48 and 500 but not smaller.

  If you haven't already, try aligning thash.  It might matter.  Couldn't hurt.Quote from: tcatm on August 14, 2010, 12:53:07 AMLooks like we're triggering a compiler bug in the tree optimizer. Can you try to compile it -O0?No help from -O0, same error.MinGW is GCC 3.4.5.  Probably the problem.I'll see if I can get a newer version of MinGW.

  That's surprising that we've never heard of that before now.Maybe you're the first person to ever run it on Vista   I have to guess it has something to do with your display color depth selection.  e.g. 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit, what is it?  Do you have a weird video card, display setup or running it on a tablet or mobile or something?

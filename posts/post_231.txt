  Download links available now on bitcoin.org.  Everyone should upgrade to this version.- Added a simple security safeguard that locks-in the block chain up to this point.- Reduced addr messages to save bandwidth now that there are plenty of nodes to connect to.- Spanish translation by milkiway.- French translation by aidos.The security safeguard makes it so even if someone does have more than 50% of the network's CPU power, they can't try to go back and redo the block chain before yesterday.  (if you have this update)I'll probably put a checkpoint in each version from now on.  Once the software has settled what the widely accepted block chain is, there's no point in leaving open the unwanted non-zero possibility of revision months later.

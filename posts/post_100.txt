  Does it happen every time you run it, or just happened once at some random time?I've never seen that fail before.  It's a call to OpenSSL that I assumed would never fail, but I put an error check there just in case.  I can't imagine how it would fail.  Out of memory maybe.The code is:key.h:    EC_KEY* pkey;        pkey = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_secp256k1);        if (pkey == NULL)            throw key_error("CKey::CKey() : EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name failed");NID_secp256k1 is a constant.

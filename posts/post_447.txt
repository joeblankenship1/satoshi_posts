  Quote from: teknohog on September 09, 2010, 07:32:05 PMSince the function CallCPUID function contains x86 assembler, it breaks the build on other architectures. I've changed line 2770 in main.cpp to#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined(CRYPTOPP_X86_ASM_AVAILABLE)to make it compile again, at least on ARM.Added in SVN rev 152

  It doesn't have to be such a breaking change.  New nodes could accept old transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded before starting to refuse transactions without PoW.  Or, they could always accept old transactions, but only a limited number per time period.I've thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better.  0.01 is basically a proof of work, but not wasted.  But if the problem is validating loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea where an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected.  Then an attacker would still need a substantial portion of the network's power to benefit from a DoS attack.Quote from: gavinandresen on August 11, 2010, 04:10:56 PMBitcoin's p2p network is subject to various kinds of denial of service attacks.There, I said it.+1Any demonstration tests at this point would only show what we already know, and divert dev time from strengthening the system to operational fire fighting.

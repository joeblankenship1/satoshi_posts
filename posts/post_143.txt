  Here's RC1 for linux for testing:(link removed, see below)It contains both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.Recent changes:build-unix.txt:- Added instructions for building wxBase, which is needed to compile bitcoind.- The package libboost-dev doesn't install anything anymore, you need to get libboost-all-dev.- Updated version numbers.makefile.unix:- The libboost libraries have removed the "-mt" from their filenames in 1.40. Â If you're compiling with Boost 1.38 or lower, like on Ubuntu Karmic, you would need to change it back to boost_system-mt and boost_filesystem-mt.
